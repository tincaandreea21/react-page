            Hello again! Thanks for checking my page!! ðŸ¤— I recently finished a
            Web Development (javaScript) course from The Informal School of IT,
            Cluj-Napoca.
          </p>
          <p className="text-p">
            Other than coding, I spend most of my free time playing Hollow
            Knight or any other video games. ðŸ¤“ I've also been trying to read
            more so feel free to reach out to me with any book recommendations!
